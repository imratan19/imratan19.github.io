        <title>the climax</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;i’m almost at the end of a cliffhanger and the doorbell chimes. i try to grab just another sentence. it chimes again; this time twice in quick succession. “wait up”, i mutter under my breath and make a bolt for the door in order to wind up the business in a jiffy and return to the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i open the door with suggestive impatience and find a cousin baring her denture at me. i’m stunned and at a loss of words. i think aloud between clenched lips to what do i owe the pleasure of her company. she misinterprets my expression to be that of pleasant surprise. she barges into the living room brushing me aside. i clutch the doorknob and prevent myself from tottering over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she drones on. my gaze oscillates between the wall clock and her rapidly vibrating lips while my attention hinges on the last sentence i had read. she jerks me out of the reverie by snapping her fingers right in front of my eyes. i return with a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“fetch me a glass of water please”, she requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i drag myself towards the kitchen with leaden steps and pour water into the tumbler like a man who has just been slapped by the queen of england. i return to the living room to find it devoid of the cousin. an inadvertent smile escapes my lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then suddenly, a shrill cry of ecstasy rents the serenity of my abode. i  make a dash in the direction of the source and find the cousin in the study sitting at my desk flipping through the pages of the book i’d been reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“i finished reading it yesterday”, she announces pointing at the book and ad-libs without warning, “you know what? jonathan was murdered by alexander rhymes!”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>the golgappa</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;yes, a valid passport of india does warrant your citizenship but if you haven’t tasted the most famous food the streets of this country have to offer then i see no reason to christen you as a compatriot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the street food under advisement is “golgappa”. it’s a puffed ball, about two inches in diameter, made of refined flour. the vendor punctures the ball with his thumb and dunks it into a potful of an extremely tangy preparation ornamented with rich spices and hands it over to his client, that is, you. you are now supposed to devour the entire “golgappa” in a go and relish the tangy aftertaste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the marriage of the “golgappa” and the tangy preparation that goes along with it leaves it’s connoisseur craving for more. after having downed the first “golgappa”, you reach for another one, then another. this goes on for quite some time until you’ve stuffed yourself to your heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a word of caution, though. the “golgappa” vendor, and other mobile street food vendors for that matter, sells his wares in the hot and humid conditions of india without even a single break. he relieves himself at a secluded place and he’s not even obliged to wash his hands before serving his clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nevertheless, the populace prefers to be blissfully ignorant to this fact. so, if you choose to fall in then enjoy the “golgappa”.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>regret</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;i never quite had any regret in life until i got married. i do not mean to say that I regret getting married to the person i’m currently married to but I regret not getting married to her a decade ago when i attained the legal marriageable age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i strongly believe that this will be my biggest regret in life, ever.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>the smudged notebook</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;well, i’m sure that each one of us at some point of time has regretted smudging the first few pages of a prized notebook because our thoughts are too befuddled to develop into choicest words on paper. as the first entry commences a journey into the unknown, the remorse of muddling it lingers until the first milestone is reached or even longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;doesn’t the same sort of resentment envelopes us in daily life, as well, when we’ve made a mess of things and wish we could start over? well, life does not offer us an option to wipe the slate clean. taking the “notebook” analogy further, the best we can do is to make proper use of the remaining pages and compose a beautiful story with a clear conscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the last full stop on the very last page of the life’s notebook must be rendered with a hearty twist of the pen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>a name for xenia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;xenia is a concept of empathy in greek mythology. i named my daughter thus so that she grows up to be a compassionate woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;according to the sikh religious practices, an infant must be bestowed a name after one and a quarter month of birth in the presence of the holy Guru Granth Sahib. the first letter of the name must be the first letter of the stanza read from the holy book at the beginning of the day on which the name is to be bestowed. now this lessens the probability of choosing the name of one’s liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;practicing religion is good but only as long as it does not stifle one’s freedom of expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by the way, the first letter of today’s stanza is ‘j’. i suggested ‘jazzlyn’. the consensus, that is grandpa, grandma and mom, swears by ‘jasnoor’ - the light of god. I stand by what  shakespeare says that names are meaningless, actions are what matter the most.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>on writing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;each one of us is born with the ability to appreciate art; some of us just have this ability more pronounced than others. well, writing is an art form that needs no formal training to start, appreciate and master. we’ve an innate ability to tell stories, writing’s just putting these stories into words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’d advocate a dentist be formally trained before he pulls out a tooth but not a writer. writing acumen can be nurtured over the years with practice and the love for the art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ruskin bond suggests that if one writes everyday for the rest his life, he’s is bound to get published at some point of time. well, publication is not the motivation here. what motivates me to write is the joy of telling stories and the happiness of sharing my thoughts with others. obviously the editor of nyt or harper collins may not like my work but sometimes we should try to please ourselves rather than potter around others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and if you can’t find a story you wish to read, write it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>the ghost</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;it was half past one and the eerie stillness of the moonless night made me uncomfortable as i walked down the deserted street towards my apartment. there was not a soul stirring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;suddenly, a faint sound of a woman sobbing trickled into my ears. i gathered pace in the direction of the source to help the woman in distress. the sobbing grew louder but i was not able to trace her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i was still trying to locate the woman when a piercing wail from behind jolted my being and almost paralysed me for a few seconds. chill ran down my spine and i felt my body temperature drop rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i mustered up enough courage and turned over. a few steps away from me stood an unearthly apparition of a frightening spectre. its humanlike form hung a few feet above the ground and blotted the dark grey setting of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when i woke up at the sound of the birds chirping in the trees at the break of dawn, i found myself sprawled on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>the sweeper</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;the dust settles to reveal a lanky woman bent double with age wielding a broom in vigorous short semicircular motions over a patch of land. the metronome composed by the broom’s twigs brushing against the asphalt puts her in a trance so deep that her movements appear mechanical. the relentless sun and the cacophonous birds fail to break her concentration. though she raises an occasional brow at a kid who playfully tramples over the dry leaves she had just gathered in a heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as I walk past her, we catch sight. her eyes set against the dunes of time accentuate the grim demeanour she exudes. her lips part but an inhibition buried deep inside dilutes her urge to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the distance grows between us but the metronome’s pitch remains undiminished.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>xenia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;today’s the happiest day of my life. i’ve never been happier. if truth be told, i’ve neither erupted in hysteria nor jumped publicly in joy before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, i became a father half an hour ago and have just met my baby girl. she’s the prettiest being i ever saw in my puff. when i addressed her xenia - the name i chose even before she was conceived, she tendered a perplexed look in my direction for an instance while chewing on her right fist and then suddenenly burst into a feeble cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;although our first meeting was brief, yet it’s very warmth will remain forever etched in my memory.&lt;/p&gt;
