yes, a valid passport of india does warrant your citizenship but if you haven't tasted the most famous food the streets of this country have to offer then i see no reason to christen you as a compatriot. 

the street food under advisement is "golgappa". it's a puffed ball, about two inches in diameter, made of refined flour. the vendor punctures the ball with his thumb and dunks it into a potful of an extremely tangy preparation ornamented with rich spices and hands it over to his client, that is, you. you are now supposed to devour the entire "golgappa" in a go and relish the tangy aftertaste. 

the marriage of the "golgappa" and the tangy preparation that goes along with it leaves it's connoisseur craving for more. after having downed the first "golgappa", you reach for another one, then another. this goes on for quite some time until you've stuffed yourself to your heart's content. 

a word of caution, though. the "golgappa" vendor, and other mobile street food vendors for that matter, sells his wares in the hot and humid conditions of india without even a single break. he relieves himself at a secluded place and he's not even obliged to wash his hands before serving his clients.

nevertheless, the populace prefers to be blissfully ignorant to this fact. so, if you choose to fall in then enjoy the "golgappa".
