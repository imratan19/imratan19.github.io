xenia is a concept of empathy in greek mythology. i named my daughter thus so that she grows up to be a compassionate woman.

according to the sikh religious practices, an infant must be bestowed a name after one and a quarter month of birth in the presence of the holy Guru Granth Sahib. the first letter of the name must be the first letter of the stanza read from the holy book at the beginning of the day on which the name is to be bestowed. now this lessens the probability of choosing the name of one's liking. 

practicing religion is good but only as long as it does not stifle one's freedom of expression.

by the way, the first letter of today's stanza is 'j'. i suggested 'jazzlyn'. the consensus, that is grandpa, grandma and mom, swears by 'jasnoor' - the light of god. I stand by what  shakespeare says that names are meaningless, actions are what matter the most.
