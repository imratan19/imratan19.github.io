the dust settles to reveal a lanky woman bent double with age wielding a broom in vigorous short semicircular motions over a patch of land. the metronome composed by the broom's twigs brushing against the asphalt puts her in a trance so deep that her movements appear mechanical. the relentless sun and the cacophonous birds fail to break her concentration. though she raises an occasional brow at a kid who playfully tramples over the dry leaves she had just gathered in a heap.

as I walk past her, we catch sight. her eyes set against the dunes of time accentuate the grim demeanour she exudes. her lips part but an inhibition buried deep inside dilutes her urge to speak.

the distance grows between us but the metronome's pitch remains undiminished.
