# on writing 

each one of us is born with the ability to appreciate art; some of us just have this ability more pronounced than others. well, writing is an art form that needs no formal training to start, appreciate and master. we've an innate ability to tell stories, writing's just putting these stories into words. 

i'd advocate a dentist be formally trained before he pulls out a tooth but not a writer. writing acumen can be nurtured over the years with practice and the love for the art.

ruskin bond suggests that if one writes everyday for the rest his life, he's is bound to get published at some point of time. well, publication is not the motivation here. what motivates me to write is the joy of telling stories and the happiness of sharing my thoughts with others. obviously the editor of nyt or harper collins may not like my work but sometimes we should try to please ourselves rather than potter around others.

and if you can't find a story you wish to read, write it.
