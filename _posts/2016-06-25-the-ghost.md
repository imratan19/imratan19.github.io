it was half past one and the eerie stillness of the moonless night made me uncomfortable as i walked down the deserted street towards my apartment. there was not a soul stirring.

suddenly, a faint sound of a woman sobbing trickled into my ears. i gathered pace in the direction of the source to help the woman in distress. the sobbing grew louder but i was not able to trace her.

i was still trying to locate the woman when a piercing wail from behind jolted my being and almost paralysed me for a few seconds. chill ran down my spine and i felt my body temperature drop rapidly.

i mustered up enough courage and turned over. a few steps away from me stood an unearthly apparition of a frightening spectre. its humanlike form hung a few feet above the ground and blotted the dark grey setting of the night.

when i woke up at the sound of the birds chirping in the trees at the break of dawn, i found myself sprawled on the ground.
