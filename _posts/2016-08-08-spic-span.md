i wished the piece of cyber real estate i owed to reflect my personality. since i firmly believe that brevity is the soul of wit, i wanted my [blog](http://blog.ratan.me) to be at its minimal best.

i tried many blogging platforms (both paid and free), none of which accorded the freedom to customize the blog exhaustively. so i decided to design and develop my blog from scratch and lend it a personal touch.

well, i'm pleased to announce that my [blog](http://blog.ratan.me) is live now with the functionality that i wished for.

afterall, as toni morrison said:
