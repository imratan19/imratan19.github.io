it has come under my observation that people who are creatively inclined tend to live longer than their contemporaries. p g wodehouse, khushwant singh, m f hussain, s h raza et al have lived well into their ninties enjoying as good a health as any nonagenarian can afford.

the reason of their longevity is directly related to this quote by [dr abdul kalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam){:target="_wiki"}:

> dream is not that which you see while sleeping it is something that does not let you sleep.

their passion kept them on their toes. they looked forward to each day as an opportunity to accomplish something exciting.

if an individual wishes to live his life to the fullest, he must try to keep his creativite juices flowing by discovering and nurturing a passion. 

a quote from a famous [bollywood flick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand_(1971_film)){:target="_wiki"} sums it all up:

> life must be large, not long.
