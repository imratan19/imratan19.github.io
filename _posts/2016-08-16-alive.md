it has come under my observation that people who are creatively inclined tend to live longer than their contemporaries. p g wodehouse, khushwant singh, m f hussain, s h raza et al have lived well into their ninties enjoying as good a health as a nonagenarian can afford.

the reason of their longevity is directly related to this quote by dr abdul kalam:

> Dream is not that which you see while sleeping it is something that does not let you sleep.
