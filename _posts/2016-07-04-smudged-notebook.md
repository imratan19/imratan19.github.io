well, i'm sure that each one of us at some point of time has regretted smudging the first few pages of a prized notebook because our thoughts are too befuddled to develop into choicest words on paper. as the first entry commences a journey into the unknown, the remorse of muddling it lingers until the first milestone is reached or even longer. 

doesn't the same sort of resentment envelopes us in daily life, as well, when we've made a mess of things and wish we could start over? well, life does not offer us an option to wipe the slate clean. taking the "notebook" analogy further, the best we can do is to make proper use of the remaining pages and compose a beautiful story with a clear conscience.

the last full stop on the very last page of the life's notebook must be rendered with a hearty twist of the pen.
