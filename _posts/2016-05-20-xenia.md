today's the happiest day of my life. i've never been happier. if truth be told, i've neither erupted in hysteria nor jumped publicly in joy before.

well, i became a father half an hour ago and have just met my baby girl. she's the prettiest being i ever saw in my puff. when i addressed her xenia - the name i chose even before she was conceived, she tendered a perplexed look in my direction for an instance while chewing on her right fist and then suddenenly burst into a feeble cry.

although our first meeting was brief, yet it's very warmth will remain forever etched in my memory.
