her man <i>must</i>:
<ul>
<li>conduct himself around her like a two-way deterministic finite automaton</li>
<li>
	rotate around her (on her complex plane) in n circles (where n &rarr; &infin;) that are not more than a unit long in radius.<br/>mathematical representation (using euler's formula):<br/> <div align=center>&sum;e<sup>2&pi;<i>i</i>n</sup></div>
</li>
<li>be adept in differential calculus and be able to identify the rate of change of her mood, predict a mood-based model specific to her idiosyncrasy and proactively take steps to make her comfortable</li>
<li>
	be equipped with a fourier transformation-esque mathematical model to decode her every single gesture or signal without her needing to utter a single syllable. 
</li>
</ul>
<br/>bet most of you guys would agree to this.
