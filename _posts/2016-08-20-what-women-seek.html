...the  following in her man.<br/><br/>

<p>he <i>must</i>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"">
<li>conduct himself around her like a two-way deterministic finite automaton</li>
<li>
	rotate around her (on her complex plane) in <i>n</i> circles (where n &rarr; &infin;) that are not more than a unit length in radius. here's a mathematical representation (using euler's formula):<br/> <div align=center>&sum;e<sup><i>i</i>(2&pi;)n</sup></div>
</li>
<li>be adept in differential calculus and be able to identify the rate of change of her mood, predict a mood-based model specific to her idiosyncrasy and proactively take steps to make her comfortable</li>
<li>
	be equipped with a fourier transformation-esque mathematical model to decode her every gesture or signal without her needing to utter a single syllable, ever
</li>
</ul>
bet most guys would agree to this.
